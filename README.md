# Secure .NET Core 8 API with JWT Authentication and Email Confirmation

This project provides a secure API built with .NET Core 8, implementing user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and email confirmation for enhanced security and user experience.

Features:

JWT-based Authentication: Users can register and log in to obtain JWT tokens for secure access to protected API endpoints.
Email Confirmation: Newly registered users receive an email with a confirmation link to activate their accounts, ensuring user validity.
Getting Started:

Prerequisites:
.NET Core 8 SDK (https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
A database (e.g., SQLite)
Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://your-repository-url.git
Usa el código con precaución.

Configure Database Connection:
Modify the connection string in appsettings.json to match your database configuration.
Run Migrations:
Bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialMigration
dotnet ef database update
Usa el código con precaución.

Start the API:
Bash
dotnet run
Usa el código con precaución.

API Endpoints:

Registration:

POST /api/users (Body: { "username": "username", "email": "email@example.com", "password": "password" })
Login:

POST /api/auth/login (Body: { "username": "username", "password": "password" })
Confirmation (upon receiving confirmation email):

GET /api/users/confirm?token={confirmationToken}
Protected Endpoints (require valid JWT token):

You can define additional secure endpoints within your API that require authentication.
Dependencies:

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite (or another database provider)
Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (optional for Swagger documentation)
Usage:

Registration: Send a POST request to /api/users with user information. Upon successful registration, a confirmation email will be sent.
Confirmation: Click the confirmation link in the email to activate your account.
Login: Send a POST request to /api/auth/login with username and password to obtain a JWT token.
Secure API Access: Include the obtained JWT token in the authorization header (Authorization: Bearer {your_token}) for subsequent requests to protected API endpoints.
Customization:

You can customize the user model, email templates, and authentication logic as needed within the project's code.
Disclaimer:

This is a basic structure to get you started. Consider implementing additional security best practices like password hashing, user validation, and role-based authorization for a production environment.

Additional Notes:

Replace your-repository-url.git with the actual URL of your repository.
Refer to the project's code for detailed implementation details and customization options.
I hope this README provides a clear and informative guide to your project!
